## Version 1.6.1 - 2024-05-19
### CHANGES:
Adds support for configurying the coverage report format

## Version 1.6.0 - 2024-05-19
### CHANGES:
Updated the tool for Xcode 15 xccov tool. ATTENTION: use version 1.5.2 of this tool, if you are still using Xcode 14. Coverage won't work otherwise.
The big change is that now we can get all the coverage data at once from xccov command line. No tedious getting coverage data for each single file.
That defeats the original purpose of this tool to generate coverage data faster than the shel script, which was provided by sonar. Now this tool is not much faster at that task, as the shell script.
But meanwhile xcresultparser offers more than only converting coverage data to xml. The Readme has you covered on this.

## Version 1.1.0 - 2022-04-03
### CHANGES:
(Kind of) Fixed the file paths in test results xml for sonarqube.
Unfortunately I didn't find the file paths for the tests in the xcresult archive.
Only the classnames of the test classes are exposed. So I use `grep` to find the
file in the directory provided with the '-p' parameter. That will only work on the machine
where the .xcresult file was created, because only there the files exist, which can be found by `grep`.
